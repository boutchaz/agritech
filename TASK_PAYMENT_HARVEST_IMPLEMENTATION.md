## üöÄ Next Steps

To deploy this system:

1. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   cd project
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Generate TypeScript Types:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate-types
   ```

3. **Seed Default Categories:**
   The migration automatically creates default task categories for each organization.

4. **Configure Permissions:**
   Ensure roles are properly configured in the database for your organization users.

5. **Test the System:**
   - Create a test task
   - Assign to a worker
   - Clock in/out
   - Calculate a payment
   - Record a harvest
   - Create a delivery

## üí° Usage Examples

### Create a Task
```typescript
const { mutateAsync: createTask } = useCreateTask();

await createTask({
  organization_id: orgId,
  farm_id: farmId,
  title: 'Taille des oliviers',
  task_type: 'pruning',
  priority: 'high',
  assigned_to: workerId,
  scheduled_start: '2025-01-25',
  estimated_duration: 8,
});
```

### Calculate Payment
```typescript
const { mutateAsync: calculatePayment } = useCalculatePayment();

const result = await calculatePayment({
  worker_id: workerId,
  period_start: '2025-01-01',
  period_end: '2025-01-31',
  include_advances: true,
});

// result contains: base_amount, overtime, deductions, net_amount
```

### Record Harvest
```typescript
const { mutateAsync: createHarvest } = useCreateHarvest();

await createHarvest({
  organization_id: orgId,
  farm_id: farmId,
  parcel_id: parcelId,
  harvest_date: '2025-01-20',
  quantity: 500,
  unit: 'kg',
  quality_grade: 'A',
  workers: [
    { worker_id: worker1Id, hours_worked: 8, quantity_picked: 250 },
    { worker_id: worker2Id, hours_worked: 8, quantity_picked: 250 },
  ],
  expected_price_per_unit: 5.5,
});
```
