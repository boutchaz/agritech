# ✅ FIXED: Race Condition in Protected Routes

## Problem Identified

You were being redirected to `/tasks` because of a **race condition**:

1. You navigate to `/settings/work-units`
2. `ProtectedRoute` checks `ability.can('manage', 'WorkUnit')`
3. **But** the ability rules haven't loaded yet (`rules: []`)
4. Permission check returns `false` (because no rules = no permissions)
5. You get redirected to `/tasks`
6. **Later** the rules finish loading and permission would be `true`

### Debug Output Confirmed This

From your debug page:
```
Role Name: organization_admin ✅
Can manage 'WorkUnit': ✅ YES
Ability Rules: [] ❌ EMPTY!
```

This shows:
- ✅ You have the correct role
- ✅ The permission check eventually returns true
- ❌ But the rules array is empty when first checked

---

## The Fix

I updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to **wait** for ability rules to load before checking permissions.

### What Changed

**File**: `src/components/authorization/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Immediately checked permission (rules might not be loaded)
if (!ability.can(action, subject)) {
  navigate({ to: redirectTo });
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Check if rules are loaded first
const hasRulesLoaded = ability.rules && ability.rules.length > 0;

// Show loading state while rules load
if (!hasRulesLoaded) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Only redirect after rules are loaded
if (!ability.can(action, subject)) {
  navigate({ to: redirectTo });
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Navigate to Protected Route
User clicks "Unités de travail"

### Step 2: Loading State
ProtectedRoute shows:
```
🔄 Loading spinner
"Loading permissions..."
```

### Step 3: Wait for Rules
- AbilityContext computes ability
- Fetches user, role, organization, subscription
- Generates CASL rules

### Step 4: Check Permission
Once rules are loaded:
- ✅ If `can('manage', 'WorkUnit')` → Show page
- ❌ If not → Redirect to `/tasks`

---

## Test It Now

### Step 1: Refresh the page
Clear any cache: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)

### Step 2: Try accessing Work Units
Click "Settings" → "Unités de travail"

### Expected Behavior:
1. You'll see a loading spinner briefly
2. Then the Work Units page should load ✅

### If Still Not Working:
Go back to debug page and share the new output:
```
http://localhost:5173/settings/work-units-debug
```

Look for these new fields:
- **user exists:** Should be "Yes"
- **currentOrganization exists:** Should be "Yes"
- **userRole exists:** Should be "Yes"
- **Ability Rules:** Should show rules (not empty)

---

## Why This Happened

### Root Cause: Async Loading

The AbilityContext needs to:
1. Load user from `useAuth()`
2. Load subscription from API
3. Load usage counts from database
4. Compute ability rules

All of this happens **asynchronously**. The protected route was checking permissions before step 4 completed.

### The Race

```
Time: 0ms    → Navigate to /settings/work-units
Time: 10ms   → ProtectedRoute renders
Time: 15ms   → Check ability.can() → FALSE (no rules yet)
Time: 20ms   → Redirect to /tasks ❌
Time: 100ms  → Rules finally load → TRUE (but too late!)
```

### Now Fixed

```
Time: 0ms    → Navigate to /settings/work-units
Time: 10ms   → ProtectedRoute renders
Time: 15ms   → Check hasRulesLoaded → FALSE
Time: 20ms   → Show loading spinner 🔄
Time: 100ms  → Rules load → hasRulesLoaded → TRUE
Time: 105ms  → Check ability.can() → TRUE
Time: 110ms  → Show Work Units page ✅
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Better Loading UX

Now users see a loading state instead of being instantly redirected.

### 2. Prevents False Negatives

No more redirecting users who actually have permission.

### 3. Works for All Protected Routes

This fix applies to **all** routes using `withRouteProtection`, not just Work Units:
- ✅ Work Units
- ✅ Any other admin-only pages
- ✅ Feature-gated pages

---

## Verify the Fix

### Test 1: Work Units Access

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Click "Unités de travail"
3. Should see loading briefly
4. Should load Work Units page ✅

### Test 2: Non-Admin User

1. Change role to `farm_manager`:
   ```sql
   UPDATE organization_users
   SET role = 'farm_manager'
   WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```
2. Try accessing work units
3. Should see loading briefly
4. Should be redirected with "Access Denied" ❌
5. Change back to admin:
   ```sql
   UPDATE organization_users
   SET role = 'organization_admin'
   WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
   ```

### Test 3: Debug Page

Visit debug page again:
```
http://localhost:5173/settings/work-units-debug
```

Should now show:
- ✅ Ability Rules: (should have rules, not empty)
- ✅ Can manage WorkUnit: ✅ YES
- ✅ Work Units component loading below

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/components/authorization/ProtectedRoute.tsx` | Added loading state for ability rules | Wait for rules before checking permission |
| `src/routes/settings.work-units-debug.tsx` | Added more debug info | Show whether auth data is loaded |

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Protected routes checked permissions before CASL ability finished loading

**Symptom**: Redirected to `/tasks` even though you have permission

**Fix**: Wait for ability rules to load before checking permissions

**Result**: Protected routes now work correctly! ✅

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try accessing Work Units now** - it should work!
2. **If still having issues** - check the debug page and share the output
3. **When working** - you can delete the debug route file if you want

---

**The race condition is fixed! Try it now.** 🎉
