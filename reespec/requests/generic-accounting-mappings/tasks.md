# Tasks: Generic Accounting Mappings

## Prerequisites
- Existing test infra: Vitest for unit tests
- Existing services: AccountingAutomationService, AccountMappingsService, InvoicesService, PaymentsService

---

### 1. Seed new mapping types for all 6 countries

- [x] **RED** — Query the schema SQL for mapping_type = 'receivable' in account_mappings seed. Confirm: zero rows exist. Assertion: no `receivable`, `payable`, `tax`, `revenue`, `expense` mapping types in the seed SQL.
- [x] **ACTION** — Add INSERT statements to `project/supabase/migrations/00000000000000_schema.sql` for all 6 countries (MA, FR, TN, US, GB, DE) with mapping types: `receivable/trade`, `payable/trade`, `tax/collected`, `tax/deductible`, `revenue/default`, `expense/default`. Use correct account codes per country's chart of accounts.
- [x] **GREEN** — Grep the schema SQL for `receivable/trade` — confirm 6 rows (one per country). Run `cd project && npx supabase db reset` to verify no SQL errors.

---

### 2. Make getAccountIdByMapping a shared utility on AccountingAutomationService

- [x] **RED** — Write test in `agritech-api/src/modules/journal-entries/accounting-automation.service.spec.ts`: call `resolveAccountId(orgId, 'receivable', 'trade')` — method does not exist yet. Test fails.
- [x] **ACTION** — Extract `getAccountIdByMapping` from private to a public method `resolveAccountId(orgId, mappingType, mappingKey)` on `AccountingAutomationService`. Keep the private one as an internal alias for backward compat.
- [x] **GREEN** — Run the test suite for accounting-automation.service — passes. Existing tests still pass.

---

### 3. Refactor invoice posting to resolve accounts via mappings

- [x] **RED** — Write/update test in `agritech-api/src/modules/invoices/invoices.service.spec.ts`: mock `AccountingAutomationService.resolveAccountId` to return account IDs for `receivable/trade`, `tax/collected`, `revenue/default`. Post a sales invoice. Assert journal entry created with those IDs. Test fails (invoices.service doesn't use AccountingAutomationService yet).
- [x] **ACTION** — Inject `AccountingAutomationService` into `InvoicesService`. In `postInvoice()`: replace hardcoded `SALES_ACCOUNT_CODES`/`PURCHASE_ACCOUNT_CODES` lookups with `resolveAccountId()` calls for `receivable/trade`, `payable/trade`, `tax/collected`, `tax/deductible`. For per-item accounts: use `item.account_id` from invoice_items, falling back to `resolveAccountId('revenue', 'default')` for sales or `resolveAccountId('expense', 'default')` for purchase.
- [x] **GREEN** — Run invoices.service.spec.ts — all tests pass. No hardcoded account codes remain in invoices.service.ts.

---

### 4. Update ledger helper to accept resolved accounts instead of per-item income_account_id

- [x] **RED** — Write test in `agritech-api/src/modules/journal-entries/helpers/ledger.helper.spec.ts`: call `buildInvoiceLedgerLines` with items that have `account_id` set (not `income_account_id`). Also test with a `defaultRevenueAccountId` fallback. Assert correct journal lines. Test fails (helper currently requires `income_account_id`).
- [x] **ACTION** — Refactor `buildInvoiceLedgerLines`: rename `income_account_id`→`account_id` on `InvoiceItem` interface. Add `defaultRevenueAccountId`/`defaultExpenseAccountId` to `InvoiceLedgerAccounts`. Per item: use `item.account_id ?? defaultRevenueAccountId` (sales) or `item.account_id ?? defaultExpenseAccountId` (purchase). Throw if neither exists.
- [x] **GREEN** — Run ledger.helper.spec.ts — passes. Run invoices.service.spec.ts — still passes (updated in task 3 to provide new interface).

---

### 5. Refactor payment posting to resolve accounts via mappings

- [x] **RED** — Write/update test in payments.service uses hardcoded codes).
- [x] **ACTION** — Inject `AccountingAutomationService` into `PaymentsService`. Replace hardcoded `LEDGER_CODES = ['1110', '1200', '2110']` with `resolveAccountId()` calls. Remove all `.in('code', ...)` lookups.
- [x] **GREEN** — Run payments service tests — pass. No hardcoded account codes remain in payments.service.ts.

---

### 6. Wire applyTemplate to initialize account mappings

- [x] **RED** — Write/update test in accounts.service.spec.ts`: after `applyTemplate('MA', orgId)`, query `account_mappings` for the org. Assert rows exist for `receivable/trade`, `payable/trade`, etc. with non-null `account_id`. Test fails (applyTemplate currently returns `account_mappings_created: 0`).
- [x] **ACTION** — In `AccountsService.applyTemplate()`: after inserting accounts, call `AccountMappingsService.initializeDefaultMappings(orgId, countryCode)`. Import and inject `AccountMappingsService` into `AccountsModule`. Return actual count in `account_mappings_created`.
- [x] **GREEN** — Run accounts.service.spec.ts — passes. `account_mappings_created` > 0 in result.

---

### 7. Add missing mapping types to initializeDefaultMappings

- [x] **RED** — Write test in account-mappings.service.spec.ts`: call `initializeDefaultMappings(orgId, 'MA')`. Assert org mappings include `receivable/trade` with `account_id` resolved to the org's account with code `3420`. Test fails (global templates for these types don't exist yet in test DB, but seed from task 1 provides them).
- [x] **ACTION** — Verify `initializeDefaultMappings` correctly copies from global templates including the new mapping types from task 1. Fix any issues with the org context lookup (`accounting_standard` field — MA uses both 'PCEC' and 'CGNC' in different places; normalize to one).
- [x] **GREEN** — Run account-mappings.service.spec.ts — passes. All new mapping types are initialized with correct account_ids.

---

### 8. Normalize accounting_standard: PCEC vs CGNC for Morocco

- [x] **RED** — Check: search codebase for 'CGNC' and 'PCEC' — both are used for Morocco. The chart template says 'CGNC', the mapping seeds say 'PCEC'. This mismatch means `initializeDefaultMappings` won't find global templates. Assertion: grep confirms inconsistency.
- [x] **ACTION** — Standardize Morocco to one value everywhere (recommend 'PCEC' since it's used in the seeds). Update the Moroccan chart template metadata and the `getFallbackTemplate` legacy path to use 'PCEC'. Or vice versa — pick one and align.
- [x] **GREEN** — Grep for Morocco accounting_standard — only one value used across seeds, chart templates, and org defaults.

---

### 9. End-to-end integration test: Morocco invoice posting

- [ ] **RED** — Write integration test (or Playwright API test): create org → apply MA template → create sales invoice with items → post invoice → assert journal entry exists with Moroccan account codes (3420 for AR, 4457 for tax, 7111 for revenue). Test fails initially.
- [ ] **ACTION** — Fix any remaining wiring issues discovered by the E2E test. This is the integration verification.
- [ ] **GREEN** — E2E test passes. A Moroccan org can post an invoice end-to-end.

---

### 10. End-to-end integration test: France invoice posting

- [ ] **RED** — Write integration test: create org with FR template → create sales invoice → post → assert journal uses French account codes (411 for AR, 44571 for tax, 701 for revenue). Test fails initially.
- [ ] **ACTION** — Fix any country-specific issues discovered.
- [ ] **GREEN** — E2E test passes. A French org can post an invoice end-to-end.
