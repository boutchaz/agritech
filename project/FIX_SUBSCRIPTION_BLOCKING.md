# Fix: Users Not Being Blocked Without Subscription

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Users are **NOT being blocked** even without paid subscriptions because:

### Root Cause
**Automatic trial subscriptions are being created** for all new organizations by a database trigger:

```sql
-- This trigger creates 14-day trial for EVERY new organization
CREATE TRIGGER on_organization_created_subscription
  AFTER INSERT ON public.organizations
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.initialize_default_subscription();
```

This means:
- ❌ All users get free 14-day trial automatically
- ❌ No one is forced to subscribe
- ❌ System appears to "not work"

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Debug Current State

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy and paste contents of:
scripts/debug-subscriptions.sql
```

This will show you:
- How many trial subscriptions exist
- Which organizations have free access
- Whether auto-trial trigger is enabled

### Step 2: Apply Fix Migration

Deploy the fix migration:

```bash
cd /Users/boutchaz/Documents/CodeLovers/agritech/project
supabase db push
```

This applies: `20251002210000_disable_auto_trials.sql`

**What it does:**
1. ✅ **Disables auto-trial trigger** - No more free trials
2. ✅ **Expires all existing trials** - Sets status to `past_due`
3. ✅ **Blocks subscription creation from frontend** - Only backend can create
4. ✅ **Enforces payment requirement** - Must use Polar.sh

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

Run verification:

```sql
-- Check if trigger is disabled
SELECT tgname, tgenabled FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname = 'on_organization_created_subscription';
-- Should show: tgenabled = 'D' (disabled)

-- Check trial subscriptions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscriptions WHERE status = 'trialing';
-- Should show: 0 (all converted to past_due)

-- Check blocking is working
SELECT has_valid_subscription('some-org-id');
-- Should return: false (for orgs without paid subscription)
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

1. **Login to your app**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Check for logs**:
   ```
   ✅ Subscription check result: { isValid: false, reason: 'past_due' }
   ```
4. **You should see**: Subscription Required screen

### Step 5: Grant Subscriptions (Optional)

If you want to give specific organizations access:

#### Option A: Via Polar.sh (Recommended)
- User goes through Polar.sh checkout
- Webhook creates subscription automatically
- Status = `active`

#### Option B: Manually (For Testing)
```sql
-- Give test organization active subscription
INSERT INTO subscriptions (
  organization_id,
  plan_type,
  status,
  current_period_start,
  current_period_end
) VALUES (
  'your-org-id',
  'professional',
  'active',
  NOW(),
  NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'
) ON CONFLICT (organization_id) DO UPDATE
SET
  status = 'active',
  plan_type = 'professional',
  current_period_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Current State - Not Working)

| Organization | Subscription | Access | Why |
|--------------|--------------|--------|-----|
| Org A | Trial (auto) | ✅ Allowed | Free trial |
| Org B | Trial (auto) | ✅ Allowed | Free trial |
| Org C | None | ❌ Blocked | No subscription |

**Problem**: Orgs A & B have free access via auto-trial

### AFTER (Fixed State - Working)

| Organization | Subscription | Access | Why |
|--------------|--------------|--------|-----|
| Org A | Past Due (expired trial) | ❌ Blocked | Trial expired |
| Org B | Past Due (expired trial) | ❌ Blocked | Trial expired |
| Org C | None | ❌ Blocked | No subscription |
| Org D | Active (paid) | ✅ Allowed | Paid subscription |

**Fixed**: Only orgs with `status = 'active'` can access

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: New Organization
```sql
-- Create new org
INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('Test Org');

-- Check if subscription created
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE organization_id = (
  SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Test Org'
);
-- Expected: NO ROWS (trigger disabled)

-- Check access
SELECT has_valid_subscription(
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Test Org')
);
-- Expected: false
```

### Test 2: Existing Trial Users
```sql
-- Check current trials
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE status = 'trialing';
-- Expected: 0 rows (all expired)

-- Check access for former trial user
SELECT has_valid_subscription('former-trial-org-id');
-- Expected: false
```

### Test 3: Paid Subscription
```sql
-- Create paid subscription
INSERT INTO subscriptions (organization_id, plan_type, status)
VALUES ('test-org-id', 'professional', 'active');

-- Check access
SELECT has_valid_subscription('test-org-id');
-- Expected: true
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Preservation
- ✅ Existing subscriptions are **NOT deleted**
- ✅ Trial status changed to `past_due` (preserved for records)
- ✅ Organization data remains intact
- ✅ Can restore access by updating subscription status

### User Impact
After applying fix:
- ❌ All trial users will be **blocked immediately**
- ❌ They'll see "Subscription Required" screen
- ✅ They can click "View Plans" to subscribe
- ✅ After payment, access is restored automatically

### Gradual Rollout (Alternative)
If you want gradual enforcement:

```sql
-- Don't expire trials, just extend them by 30 days
UPDATE subscriptions
SET current_period_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'
WHERE status = 'trialing';

-- Then disable auto-trial trigger (in migration)
-- Users have 30 more days to subscribe
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] `debug-subscriptions.sql` run to understand current state
- [ ] Decision made: immediate block vs gradual
- [ ] Communication sent to trial users (if any)

Deploy:
- [ ] Run `supabase db push` to apply migration
- [ ] Verify trigger disabled
- [ ] Verify trials expired/converted
- [ ] Test with test organization
- [ ] Monitor Edge Function logs
- [ ] Check browser console for subscription check logs

After deploying:
- [ ] Verify users are being blocked
- [ ] Test Polar.sh payment flow works
- [ ] Monitor support requests
- [ ] Track conversion rate

## 🆘 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback:

```sql
-- Re-enable auto-trial trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_organization_created_subscription
  AFTER INSERT ON public.organizations
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.initialize_default_subscription();

-- Restore trials (if within 14 days of creation)
UPDATE subscriptions
SET
  status = 'trialing',
  current_period_end = created_at + INTERVAL '14 days'
WHERE status = 'past_due'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days';
```

## 📞 Support

If users report issues:

1. **Check their subscription status**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM subscription_status
   WHERE organization_id = 'their-org-id';
   ```

2. **Check Edge Function logs**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs check-subscription
   ```

3. **Verify they have access**:
   ```sql
   SELECT has_valid_subscription('their-org-id');
   ```

4. **Grant temporary access** (if legitimate):
   ```sql
   UPDATE subscriptions
   SET
     status = 'active',
     current_period_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'
   WHERE organization_id = 'their-org-id';
   ```

## ✨ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Browser console shows: `isValid: false`
2. ✅ Users see: "Subscription Required" screen
3. ✅ New organizations don't get auto-trial
4. ✅ Only users with `status = 'active'` can access
5. ✅ RLS policies block resource creation

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Apply the fix migration** (Step 2 above)
2. **Verify it's working** (Step 3-4)
3. **Test payment flow** via Polar.sh
4. **Monitor logs** for issues
5. **Support users** who need to subscribe

---

**The fix is ready to deploy. Once applied, all users without paid subscriptions will be blocked immediately.** 🚀
