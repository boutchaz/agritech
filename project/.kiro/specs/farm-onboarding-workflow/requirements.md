# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive farm onboarding and data collection workflow system that guides users through the complete process of setting up a new farm in the application. The system covers everything from initial farm visits and assessments to sensor installation, data collection configuration, and AI-powered analysis setup. This workflow ensures that farms are properly configured with all necessary data collection points, homogeneous zones are defined, and appropriate monitoring systems are established based on crop types and farming methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farm consultant, I want to conduct a structured farm visit assessment, so that I can gather all necessary information to properly configure the farm in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a new farm onboarding THEN the system SHALL present a farm visit checklist interface
2. WHEN conducting a farm visit THEN the system SHALL provide forms for soil testing data entry
3. WHEN conducting a farm visit THEN the system SHALL provide forms for water quality testing data entry
4. WHEN conducting a farm visit THEN the system SHALL allow mapping of farm areas into homogeneous zones
5. WHEN conducting a farm visit THEN the system SHALL provide an irrigation system audit checklist
6. WHEN conducting a farm visit THEN the system SHALL allow documentation of existing infrastructure and equipment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want to configure my farm's production parameters, so that the system can provide accurate monitoring and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL allow selection of crop types and varieties
2. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL capture planting dates and growth phases
3. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL record available facilities and equipment
4. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL document available workforce capacity
5. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL define Areas of Interest (AOI) for monitoring
6. WHEN setting up farm production THEN the system SHALL validate that all required production parameters are complete

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical specialist, I want to plan and configure sensor installations, so that appropriate IoT monitoring is established for the farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning sensor installation THEN the system SHALL recommend sensor types based on crop and farming method
2. WHEN planning sensor installation THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal sensor placement locations
3. WHEN planning sensor installation THEN the system SHALL generate a sensor installation checklist
4. WHEN sensors are installed THEN the system SHALL allow recording of sensor locations and configurations
5. WHEN sensors are installed THEN the system SHALL validate sensor connectivity and data transmission
6. WHEN sensors are installed THEN the system SHALL configure data collection schedules based on crop growth phases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farm operator, I want the system to automatically collect and analyze farm data, so that I can receive actionable insights and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data collection is active THEN the system SHALL collect IoT sensor data according to configured schedules
2. WHEN data collection is active THEN the system SHALL retrieve satellite imagery and indices for defined AOIs
3. WHEN data collection is active THEN the system SHALL organize data collection by crop growth phases
4. WHEN sufficient data is available THEN the system SHALL perform AI analysis to generate insights
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate predicted yield estimates
6. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for farm management
7. WHEN data collection encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log issues and notify administrators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farm owner, I want to track the progress of my farm onboarding, so that I can ensure all setup steps are completed properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN farm onboarding begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress tracker showing all workflow steps
2. WHEN each workflow step is completed THEN the system SHALL update the progress tracker
3. WHEN a workflow step has validation errors THEN the system SHALL highlight the issues and prevent progression
4. WHEN all workflow steps are complete THEN the system SHALL activate full farm monitoring and analysis
5. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a farm setup summary report
6. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL send notifications to relevant stakeholders
