## Step 3: Get Product IDs

After creating all products:

1. Go to each product
2. Copy the Product ID (looks like: `prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
3. Note them down:
   - Essential Plan ID: `prod_xxx...`
   - Professional Plan ID: `prod_xxx...`
   - Enterprise Plan ID: `prod_xxx...`

---

## Step 4: Update Your .env (Already Done)

Your `.env` should have:
```
VITE_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=polar_at_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
VITE_POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=ab0b4a8a-e641-452c-b79a-c3e245b5093a
```

## Step 5: Test Subscription Page

1. Make sure database migration is applied (see TESTING_SUBSCRIPTION.md)
2. Visit: `http://localhost:5173/settings/subscription`
3. You should see all three plans displayed

---

## Step 6: Setup Webhook (Optional for now)

Follow `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` to configure webhooks when you're ready to test real subscriptions.

---

## Verification Checklist

âœ… Three products created in Polar.sh
âœ… Each product has correct pricing
âœ… Metadata `plan_type` is set for each
âœ… Essential & Professional have fixed monthly prices
âœ… Enterprise is contact sales
âœ… Professional is marked as "highlighted"

---

## Next Steps

1. Test the subscription page with the products
2. Apply database migration (create subscriptions table)
3. Create test subscription in database
4. Test feature gating
5. Setup webhooks for production

---

That's it! Much easier than fighting with the API ðŸ˜Š

Once you have the products created, you can test everything locally without needing webhooks initially.
