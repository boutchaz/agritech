     ID: prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

   ‚Ä¢ Professional Plan (professional)
     ID: prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

   ‚Ä¢ Agri-Business Plan (enterprise)
     ID: prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

üìù Next Steps:

1. Go to Polar.sh dashboard to verify products
2. Configure webhook endpoint (see WEBHOOK_SETUP.md)
3. Test subscription flow in your app
4. Visit: http://localhost:5173/settings/subscription
```

### Verify in Polar.sh Dashboard

1. Go to https://polar.sh/dashboard
2. Navigate to **Products** section
3. You should see all three products listed
4. Click each to verify:
   - Correct pricing
   - Metadata includes `plan_type`
   - Description is set

### Troubleshooting

**"Missing required environment variables"**
- Check your `.env` file has `VITE_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `VITE_POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- Values should start with `polar_at_` and `org_` respectively

**"401 Unauthorized"**
- API token is invalid or expired
- Generate new token in Polar.sh Settings ‚Üí API Keys
- Make sure token has "Create Products" permission

**"Failed to create product"**
- Product with same name might already exist
- Check Polar.sh dashboard and delete duplicates
- Or modify product names in the script

**"Failed to create price"**
- Product was created but pricing failed
- You can add prices manually in Polar.sh dashboard
- Or run script again (it will skip existing products)

### Customizing Products

Edit `scripts/setup-polar-products.js` to customize:

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    name: 'Your Plan Name',
    description: 'Your description',
    price_amount: 2500, // Price in cents ($25.00)
    metadata: {
      plan_type: 'your_type',
      // Add custom metadata
    },
  },
];
```

### Alternative: Manual Creation

If you prefer to create products manually:

1. Go to Polar.sh Dashboard ‚Üí Products
2. Click "Create Product"
3. Fill in details for each plan
4. **Important**: Add metadata `plan_type` to each:
   - Essential: `{"plan_type": "essential"}`
   - Professional: `{"plan_type": "professional"}`
   - Enterprise: `{"plan_type": "enterprise"}`

The metadata is crucial for the webhook to work correctly!
