-- Complete test of subscription blocking system
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor while logged in as a user

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. VERIFY YOU CAN READ CRITICAL TABLES (should work)
-- ============================================================================

SELECT '‚úÖ Step 1: Reading critical tables (should work)' as test_step;

SELECT 'Organizations' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM organizations;
SELECT 'Organization Users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM organization_users;
SELECT 'Subscriptions' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM subscriptions;

-- ============================================================================
-- 2. CHECK YOUR SUBSCRIPTION STATUS
-- ============================================================================

SELECT '‚úÖ Step 2: Checking subscription status' as test_step;

SELECT
  ou.organization_id,
  o.name as org_name,
  has_valid_subscription(ou.organization_id) as has_valid_sub,

FROM organization_users ou
JOIN organizations o ON ou.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN subscriptions s ON ou.organization_id = s.organization_id
WHERE ou.user_id = auth.uid()
LIMIT 1;

-- Expected: has_valid_sub = false, subscription_status = NULL or 'past_due'

-- ============================================================================
-- 3. TEST DATA ACCESS (should be blocked)
-- ============================================================================

SELECT '‚úÖ Step 3: Attempting to read protected tables (should be blocked)' as test_step;

-- These should return 0 rows because RLS blocks access
SELECT 'Farms' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM farms;
SELECT 'Parcels' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM parcels;
SELECT 'Employees' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM employees;

-- Expected: All counts should be 0 (blocked by RLS)

-- ============================================================================
-- 4. TEST WRITE ACCESS (should fail)
-- ============================================================================

-- Uncomment to test (will throw error):
/*
INSERT INTO farms (name, organization_id)
VALUES (
  'Test Farm',
  (SELECT organization_id FROM organization_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1)
);

-- Expected: ERROR - "Cannot perform this operation: Active subscription required"
