# Weather & Climate Analytics Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **Weather & Climate Analytics** feature for individual farm parcels in your agritech application. This feature provides farmers with actionable insights by comparing current weather conditions against long-term historical climate normals (LTN) for their specific parcel's location.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Temperature Analysis** (3 Multi-Series Line Charts)
Each chart displays current daily values alongside historical normals:
- **Minimum Temperature**: Current vs. LTN minimum temperatures
- **Mean Temperature**: Current vs. LTN mean temperatures
- **Maximum Temperature**: Current vs. LTN maximum temperatures

All temperature charts include:
- Interactive tooltips showing exact values for both series
- Date-based X-axis with automatic formatting
- Temperature in Celsius on Y-axis
- Visual distinction between current (solid line) and LTN (dashed line)

### 2. **Precipitation Analysis** (Grouped Bar Chart)
Monthly rainfall comparison showing:
- Current month's total precipitation
- Long-term normal (LTN) precipitation for that month
- Side-by-side bars for easy visual comparison
- Interactive tooltips with exact precipitation values in mm

### 3. **Dry/Wet Conditions Analysis** (4 Combination Charts)
Each metric includes a primary bar chart, LTN line overlay, and a deficit/excess bar chart:

#### **Wet Days Analysis**
- Count of days with > 1mm rainfall
- LTN comparison
- Deficit/Excess calculation

#### **Dry Days Analysis**
- Count of dry days per month
- LTN comparison
- Deficit/Excess calculation

#### **Dry Spell Conditions (DSC)**
- Count of 5-day periods with < 5mm total rainfall
- LTN comparison
- Deficit/Excess calculation

#### **Short Dry Spells**
- Count of 1-3 consecutive dry day events
- LTN comparison
- Deficit/Excess calculation

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```

├── services/
│   └── weatherClimateService.ts       # Weather data fetching & processing
├── hooks/
│   └── useWeatherAnalytics.ts         # React hook for weather data
└── components/
    └── WeatherAnalytics/
        ├── WeatherAnalyticsView.tsx   # Main container component
        ├── TemperatureCharts.tsx      # Temperature analysis charts
        ├── PrecipitationChart.tsx     # Precipitation bar chart
        └── DryWetConditionsCharts.tsx # Dry/wet conditions analysis
```

### Data Source

**Open-Meteo API** (https://open-meteo.com)
- Free, no API key required
- Historical weather data (archive API)
- Climate normals calculated from 10+ years of historical data
- Automatic coordinate conversion (Web Mercator → WGS84)
- Centroid calculation from parcel boundaries

### Key Components

#### 1. **weatherClimateService.ts**
Core service handling:
- Fetching current weather data by date range
- Calculating climate normals from historical data (30-year averages)
- Computing derived metrics (wet days, dry spells, etc.)
- Coordinate conversion and parcel location handling

```typescript
const analyticsData = await weatherClimateService.getWeatherAnalytics(
  parcelBoundary,
  startDate,
  endDate
);
```

#### 2. **useWeatherAnalytics Hook**
Custom React hook providing:
- Automatic data fetching based on parcel boundary
- Time range management (3/6/12 months, YTD, custom)
- Loading and error states
- Automatic date range calculation

```typescript
const { data, loading, error } = useWeatherAnalytics({
  parcelBoundary,
  timeRange: 'last-12-months',
});
```

#### 3. **WeatherAnalyticsView Component**
Main UI component featuring:
- Time range selector (3 months, 6 months, 12 months, YTD, Custom)
- Custom date range picker
- Summary cards (average temperature, total precipitation, wet days)
- Organized sections for each analysis type
- Insights and recommendations panel
- Dark mode support

### Integration

The weather analytics feature is integrated into the parcel detail view as a new tab:

**Location**: `project/src/components/ParcelCard.tsx`

**New Tab**: "Météo & Climat" (Weather & Climate)

**Requirements**:
- Parcel must have boundary coordinates defined
- If no boundary exists, displays a helpful message to set parcel limits

## User Experience

### Time Range Selection
Users can analyze weather data across different periods:
- **3 derniers mois** (Last 3 months)
- **6 derniers mois** (Last 6 months)
- **12 derniers mois** (Last 12 months) - Default
- **Année en cours** (Year to date)
- **Personnalisée** (Custom range with date pickers)

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface with card-based layout
- Consistent color coding:
  - Blue: Temperature/current data
  - Gray/dashed: Historical normals (LTN)
  - Cyan: Precipitation
  - Green: Wet days
  - Amber: Dry days
  - Red: Dry spells
  - Purple: Short dry spells
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Dark mode compatibility throughout

### Summary Metrics
Three prominent summary cards display:
1. **Average Temperature** for the selected period
2. **Total Precipitation** in mm
3. **Total Wet Days** (days with > 1mm rain)

### Insights Section
Provides context and guidance:
- Explanation of LTN (Long-Term Normals) comparison
- Definition of wet days and dry periods
- Agricultural recommendations for dry spell management

## Data Definitions

- **Wet Day**: Day with > 1mm of precipitation
- **Dry Day**: Day with ≤ 1mm of precipitation
- **Dry Spell Condition**: 5 consecutive days with < 5mm total rainfall
- **Short Dry Spell**: 1-3 consecutive dry days
- **LTN (Long-Term Normal)**: Historical average calculated from 10+ years of data

## Key Benefits

1. **Actionable Insights**: Farmers can see exactly how current conditions compare to historical norms
2. **Irrigation Planning**: Dry spell analysis helps optimize water usage
3. **Risk Management**: Early identification of drought conditions
4. **Historical Context**: Understanding whether conditions are typical or unusual
5. **Location-Specific**: Data is calculated for each parcel's exact coordinates
6. **Flexible Analysis**: Multiple time ranges for short and long-term planning

## Future Enhancements (Suggested)

1. **Forecasting**: Integrate 7-14 day weather forecasts
2. **Alerts**: Automated notifications for critical conditions (frost, drought, etc.)
3. **Export**: Download charts and data as PDF/Excel reports
4. **Crop-Specific Insights**: Tailored recommendations based on planted crops
5. **Historical Comparison**: Compare current year to specific past years
6. **Growing Degree Days**: Calculate thermal time for crop development
7. **Evapotranspiration**: Include ET data for precise irrigation scheduling

## Dependencies

The implementation uses existing project dependencies:
- **recharts** (^2.15.4) - For all chart visualizations
- **lucide-react** (^0.344.0) - For icons
- **react** (^18.2.0) & **TypeScript** (^5.2.2)

No additional packages were required.
