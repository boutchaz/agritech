# Example 2: Satellite analysis
cat > examples/satellite-analysis.md << 'EOF'
# Satellite Vegetation Index Calculation

Calculate NDVI and other vegetation indices using Google Earth Engine.

## API Usage

```typescript
const response = await satelliteApi.calculateIndices({
  aoi: { geometry: parcelBoundary, name: 'My Parcel' },
  date_range: { start_date: '2024-01-01', end_date: '2024-01-31' },
  indices: ['NDVI', 'NDRE'],
  cloud_coverage: 10
});
```

See: `project/src/components/SatelliteAnalysis/IndicesCalculator.tsx`
