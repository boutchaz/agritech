## Technical Highlights

### Database Design
- **RLS Policies**: Every table has organization-based security
- **Triggers**: Automatic calculations for totals, balances, and status updates
- **Constraints**: Strong data integrity with CHECK constraints
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Views**: Pre-built queries for reporting

### Validation
- **Client-side**: Zod schemas with custom refinements
- **Server-side**: Database constraints and triggers
- **Balance validation**: Debits must equal credits
- **Date validation**: Due dates must be >= invoice dates

### Multi-Tenancy
- All data scoped to `organization_id`
- RLS enforces data isolation
- Users can only access their organization's data
- Different permission levels per role

### Automation
- Invoice numbering: `INV-2024-00001`, `BILL-2024-00001`
- Payment numbering: `PAY-IN-2024-00001`, `PAY-OUT-2024-00001`
- Journal entry balance calculation
- Invoice total calculation from line items
- Outstanding amount updates on payment allocation
- Status updates (draft → submitted → paid)

---

## Integration Points

### Existing Modules

**1. Purchases Module**
- Auto-create purchase invoices from inventory purchases
