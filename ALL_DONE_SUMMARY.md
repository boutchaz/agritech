## 💡 How It Works

### Complete Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Ahmed plants 100 olive trees

#### 1. Setup (One-time)
```
Admin creates work unit "Tree" (Arbre)
Admin configures Ahmed for piece-work: 5 MAD per tree
```

#### 2. Record Work
```
Farm Manager records:
- Worker: Ahmed
- Date: 2025-10-31
- Units: 100 trees
- Rate: 5 MAD per tree
Total: 500 MAD (auto-calculated)
```

#### 3. Payment Calculation
```sql
SELECT * FROM calculate_worker_payment(
  'ahmed-id',
  '2025-10-01',
  '2025-10-31'
);

Returns:
- payment_type: 'piece_work'
- base_amount: 500.00 MAD
- units_completed: 100
```

#### 4. Process Payment
```
Create payment record: 500 MAD
Mark as "paid"
```

#### 5. Automatic Accounting ✨
```
Trigger automatically creates journal entry:
  Debit:  Labor Expense (6200)    500 MAD
  Credit: Bank Account (1020)     500 MAD
```

**Result**: Complete audit trail from work → payment → accounting
