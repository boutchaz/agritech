## üë• User Roles

Based on the application's features and business logic, the following user roles are recommended:

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Admin** | Manages the entire platform and all organizations. This role is for top-level administrators. | - Create, edit, and delete organizations.<br>- Manage system-wide settings.<br>- Access and manage all user accounts.<br>- View platform-wide analytics. |
| **Organization Admin** | Manages a specific organization, including its farms, users, and billing. | - Manage farms within the organization.<br>- Add, edit, and remove users from the organization.<br>- Manage organization-level settings and billing.<br>- View reports for all farms in the organization. |
| **Farm Manager** | Manages the day-to-day operations of a single farm. | - Manage parcels, including creating and updating them.<br>- Manage farm employees and day laborers.<br>- Manage infrastructure, stock, and utilities.<br>- Input data for and generate farm-specific reports.<br>- Manage product applications. |
| **Farm Worker** | A regular employee of a farm with access to specific features relevant to their work. | - View assigned tasks and schedules.<br>- Record activities (e.g., planting, harvesting).<br>- View information for parcels they are assigned to.<br>- Limited access to reports. |
| **Day Laborer** | A temporary worker with very limited access, likely for specific, short-term tasks. | - View daily tasks.<br>- Clock in and out for time tracking.<br>- Minimal data viewing permissions. |
| **Viewer** | A read-only role for stakeholders, consultants, or other observers. | - View farm data, dashboards, and reports.<br>- Cannot create, edit, or delete any data. |
