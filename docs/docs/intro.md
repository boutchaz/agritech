# AgriTech Platform Documentation

Welcome to the **AgriTech Platform** documentation! This comprehensive agricultural technology platform combines multi-tenant architecture, satellite data analysis via Google Earth Engine, and AI-powered insights to revolutionize farm management.

## What is AgriTech Platform?

AgriTech Platform is a full-stack web application designed to help agricultural businesses manage their operations efficiently. It provides:

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Organizations, farms, and parcels with role-based access control
- **Satellite Data Analysis**: Real-time vegetation indices (NDVI, NDRE, NDMI, etc.) via Google Earth Engine
- **Task Management**: Comprehensive task tracking with cost allocation
- **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking with automatic product creation
- **Accounting Module**: Full double-entry bookkeeping with invoices, payments, and financial reports
- **Worker Management**: Track permanent workers and day laborers
- **Harvest Tracking**: Record harvests and calculate profitability
- **Subscription System**: Feature gating with Polar.sh integration

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Router** (file-based routing)
- **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Leaflet** & **OpenLayers** for maps
- **ECharts** for data visualization

### Backend
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **FastAPI** (Python) for satellite processing
- **Google Earth Engine** for satellite imagery
- **Celery + Redis** for background jobs

### DevOps
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for E2E testing
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** for code quality

## Key Features

### üåç Satellite Analysis
Leverage Google Earth Engine to analyze crop health with 12+ vegetation indices. Get cloud-free imagery, historical time series, and export GeoTIFF files for GIS software.

### üìä Accounting
Full double-entry bookkeeping system with:
- Chart of Accounts hierarchy
- Sales and purchase invoices
- Payment tracking and allocation
- Financial reports (Balance Sheet, P&L, Trial Balance)
- Multi-currency support

### üåæ Farm Management
Organize your agricultural operations with:
- Multi-level hierarchy (Organizations ‚Üí Farms ‚Üí Parcels ‚Üí Sub-parcels)
- Role-based access control (6 role levels)
- Cost center tracking per farm/parcel
- Geospatial boundaries with GeoJSON

### üìã Task Management
Track all farm activities:
- Task types: irrigation, fertilization, pesticide, harvest, maintenance
- Worker assignment and labor tracking
- Cost allocation (labor, materials, utilities)
- Payment status tracking
- Calendar view

### üì¶ Inventory
Smart inventory management:
- Automatic product creation from purchases
- Packaging type support (bidon, sac, etc.)
- Stock level alerts
- Supplier and warehouse management
- Invoice attachments via Supabase Storage

### üí∞ Subscriptions
Monetize with feature gating:
- Plans: Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise
- Usage limits (farms, parcels, users, reports)
- Feature flags (analytics, sensors, API access)
- Polar.sh integration for payments
