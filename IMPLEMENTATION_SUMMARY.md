# Unit Management & Piece-Work Payment System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete **unit management and piece-work payment system** for the AgriTech platform. This allows tracking worker productivity based on **units completed** (trees planted, boxes harvested, kilograms picked, etc.) with automatic accounting integration.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration File)

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251031000001_unit_management_and_piecework.sql`

#### New Tables Created:

##### `work_units` Table
- Stores work unit definitions (Arbre, Caisse, Kg, Litre, etc.)
- Multi-language support (English, French, Arabic)
- Categories: count, weight, volume, area, length
- Tracks usage statistics

##### `piece_work_records` Table
- Records work completed by workers
- Links to workers, tasks, parcels
- Tracks units completed and rates
- Auto-calculates total amount
- Quality rating system (1-5 stars)
- Optional time tracking
- Payment status tracking

#### Extended Tables:

##### `workers` Table
- Added `default_work_unit_id` (link to preferred unit)
- Added `rate_per_unit` (default piece-work rate)
- Extended `payment_frequency` to include 'per_unit'

##### `payment_records` Table
- Added `units_completed` (total units for payment)
- Added `unit_rate` (rate used)
- Added `piece_work_ids` (links to piece-work records)

#### New Functions:

1. **`calculate_piece_work_payment()`**
   - Calculates earnings from piece-work records
   - Returns total amount, units, and record IDs

2. **`calculate_worker_payment()`**
   - Unified payment calculation for ALL payment types

4. **`seed_default_work_units()`**
   - Seeds organization with default units
   - 15 common units across all categories

#### Triggers Created:

1. **`payment_record_journal_trigger`**
   - Fires when payment status changes to 'paid'
   - Automatically creates accounting journal entry

2. **`piece_work_payment_link_trigger`**
   - Updates payment status when linked to payment record

#### Views Created:

1. **`worker_payment_summary`**
   - Aggregated view of worker earnings

## How It Works - Complete Flow

### Scenario: Worker Plants Trees

#### Step 1: Setup (One-time)

1. **Admin creates work unit "Tree"**:
   ```
   Code: TREE
   Name: Tree
   Name (French): Arbre
   Category: Count
   ```

2. **Admin configures worker for piece-work**:
   ```
   Worker: Ahmed
   Payment Type: Per-Unit
   Default Unit: Tree
   Rate per Unit: 5 MAD
   ```

#### Step 2: Record Work

**Farm Manager records work**:
```
Worker: Ahmed
Date: 2025-10-31
Unit: Tree
Units Completed: 100 trees
Rate: 5 MAD per tree
Total: 500 MAD
Quality: 5/5
```

System creates `piece_work_record` with status "pending"

#### Step 3: Calculate Payment

**End of period** (weekly/monthly):
```sql
SELECT * FROM calculate_worker_payment(
  'ahmed-uuid',
  '2025-10-01',
  '2025-10-31'
);
```

Returns:
- Payment type: piece_work
- Base amount: 500 MAD
- Units completed: 100
- Piece-work IDs: [record-uuid]

#### Step 4: Create Payment Record

System or user creates payment record:
```
Worker: Ahmed
Period: Oct 1-31, 2025
Type: piece_work
Base Amount: 500 MAD
Units: 100
Status: pending
Payment Method: bank_transfer
```

Links piece-work record to payment record (status → "approved")

#### Step 5: Process Payment

**When payment is made**:
- Update status to "paid"
- Set payment date
- **Trigger automatically creates journal entry**:
  ```
  Debit:  Labor Expense (6200)    500 MAD [Olive Farm]
  Credit: Bank Account (1020)     500 MAD [Bank Transfer]
  ```

#### Step 6: Accounting Impact

**Financial reports now show**:
- Labor expense: +500 MAD
- Bank account: -500 MAD
- Cost center "Olive Farm": +500 MAD labor cost
- Worker "Ahmed": 500 MAD paid
